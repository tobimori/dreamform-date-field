# DreamForm Date Field

This plugin adds a Date & Time field to [DreamForm](https://plugins.andkindness.com/dreamform).
It's packaged as separate plugin, since it requires the [Air Datepicker](https://air-datepicker.com/) library and is generally more opinionated than the core DreamForm fields.

This plugin requires a working installation of DreamForm with at least Version 1.4.0+ as well as a [valid DreamForm license](https://plugins.andkindness.com/dreamform/pricing) in order to be run on a public server.
